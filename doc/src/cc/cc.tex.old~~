\section*{Introduction}
Coupled Cluster theory is an important ab initio technique in computational chemistry. It is considered the most reliable and also computational affordable method for solving the electronic Schroedinger equation. 


\subsection{A non-practical way of solving the eigenvalue problem}

In our FCI discussions, we rewrote the solution of the Schroedinger equation as a set of coupled equationsin the unknown coefficients $C$. Let us repeat some of these arguments.
To obtain the eigenstates and eigenvalues in terms of non-linear equations is not a very practical approach. However, it serves the scope of linking FCI theory with approximative solutions to the many-body problem
like Coupled cluster (CC) theory 

If we assume that we have a two-body operator at most, the Slater-Condon rule 
gives then an equation for the 
correlation energy in terms of $C_i^a$ and $C_{ij}^{ab}$ only.  We get then
\[
\langle \Phi_0 | \hat{H} -E| \Phi_0\rangle + \sum_{ai}\langle \Phi_0 | \hat{H} -E|\Phi_{i}^{a} \rangle C_{i}^{a}+
\sum_{abij}\langle \Phi_0 | \hat{H} -E|\Phi_{ij}^{ab} \rangle C_{ij}^{ab}=0,
\]
or 
\[
E-E_0 =\Delta E=\sum_{ai}\langle \Phi_0 | \hat{H}|\Phi_{i}^{a} \rangle C_{i}^{a}+
\sum_{abij}\langle \Phi_0 | \hat{H}|\Phi_{ij}^{ab} \rangle C_{ij}^{ab},
\]
where the energy $E_0$ is the reference energy and $\Delta E$ defines the so-called correlation energy.
The single-particle basis functions  could be the results of a Hartree-Fock calculation or just the eigenstates of the non-interacting part of the Hamiltonian. 

In our notes on Hartree-Fock calculations, 
we have already computed the matrix $\langle \Phi_0 | \hat{H}|\Phi_{i}^{a}\rangle $ and $\langle \Phi_0 | \hat{H}|\Phi_{ij}^{ab}\rangle$.  If we are using a Hartree-Fock basis, then the matrix elements
$\langle \Phi_0 | \hat{H}|\Phi_{i}^{a}\rangle=0$ and we are left with a \emph{correlation energy} given by
\[
E-E_0 =\Delta E^{HF}=\sum_{abij}\langle \Phi_0 | \hat{H}|\Phi_{ij}^{ab} \rangle C_{ij}^{ab}. 
\]


Inserting the various matrix elements we can rewrite the previous equation as
\[
\Delta E=\sum_{ai}\langle i| \hat{f}|a \rangle C_{i}^{a}+
\sum_{abij}\langle ij | \hat{v}| ab \rangle C_{ij}^{ab}.
\]
This equation determines the correlation energy but not the coefficients $C$. 
We need more equations. Our next step is to set up
\[
\langle \Phi_i^a | \hat{H} -E| \Phi_0\rangle + \sum_{bj}\langle \Phi_i^a | \hat{H} -E|\Phi_{j}^{b} \rangle C_{j}^{b}+
\sum_{bcjk}\langle \Phi_i^a | \hat{H} -E|\Phi_{jk}^{bc} \rangle C_{jk}^{bc}+
\sum_{bcdjkl}\langle \Phi_i^a | \hat{H} -E|\Phi_{jkl}^{bcd} \rangle C_{jkl}^{bcd}=0,
\]
as this equation will allow us to find an expression for the coefficents $C_i^a$ since we can rewrite this equation as 
\[
\langle i | \hat{f}| a\rangle +\langle \Phi_i^a | \hat{H}|\Phi_{i}^{a} \rangle C_{i}^{a}+ \sum_{bj\ne ai}\langle \Phi_i^a | \hat{H}|\Phi_{j}^{b} \rangle C_{j}^{b}+
\sum_{bcjk}\langle \Phi_i^a | \hat{H}|\Phi_{jk}^{bc} \rangle C_{jk}^{bc}+
\sum_{bcdjkl}\langle \Phi_i^a | \hat{H}|\Phi_{jkl}^{bcd} \rangle C_{jkl}^{bcd}=EC_i^a.
\]

We see that on the right-hand side we have the energy $E$. This leads to a non-linear equation in the unknown coefficients. 
These equations are normally solved iteratively ( that is we can start with a guess for the coefficients $C_i^a$). A common choice is to use perturbation theory for the first guess, setting thereby
\[
 C_{i}^{a}=\frac{\langle i | \hat{f}| a\rangle}{\epsilon_i-\epsilon_a}.
\]

The observant reader will however see that we need an equation for $C_{jk}^{bc}$ and $C_{jkl}^{bcd}$ as well.
To find equations for these coefficients we need then to continue our multiplications from the left with the various
$\Phi_{H}^P$ terms. 


For $C_{jk}^{bc}$ we need then
\[
\langle \Phi_{ij}^{ab} | \hat{H} -E| \Phi_0\rangle + \sum_{kc}\langle \Phi_{ij}^{ab} | \hat{H} -E|\Phi_{k}^{c} \rangle C_{k}^{c}+
\]
\[
\sum_{cdkl}\langle \Phi_{ij}^{ab} | \hat{H} -E|\Phi_{kl}^{cd} \rangle C_{kl}^{cd}+\sum_{cdeklm}\langle \Phi_{ij}^{ab} | \hat{H} -E|\Phi_{klm}^{cde} \rangle C_{klm}^{cde}+\sum_{cdefklmn}\langle \Phi_{ij}^{ab} | \hat{H} -E|\Phi_{klmn}^{cdef} \rangle C_{klmn}^{cdef}=0,
\]
and we can isolate the coefficients $C_{kl}^{cd}$ in a similar way as we did for the coefficients $C_{i}^{a}$. 
A standard choice for the first iteration is to set 
\[
C_{ij}^{ab} =\frac{\langle ij \vert \hat{v} \vert ab \rangle}{\epsilon_i+\epsilon_j-\epsilon_a-\epsilon_b}.
\]
At the end we can rewrite our solution of the Schroedinger equation in terms of $n$ coupled equations for the coefficients $C_H^P$.
This is a very cumbersome way of solving the equation. However, by using this iterative scheme we can illustrate how we can compute the
various terms in the wave operator or correlation operator $\hat{C}$. We will later identify the calculation of the various terms $C_H^P$
as parts of different many-body approximations to full CI. In particular, we can  relate this non-linear scheme with Coupled Cluster theory and
many-body perturbation theory.


\subsection{Summarizing FCI and bringing in approximative methods}


If we can diagonalize large matrices, FCI is the method of choice since:
\begin{itemize}
\item It gives all eigenvalues, ground state and excited states

\item The eigenvectors are obtained directly from the coefficients $C_H^P$ which result from the diagonalization

\item We can compute easily expectation values of other operators, as well as transition probabilities

\item Correlations are easy to understand in terms of contributions to a given operator beyond the Hartree-Fock contribution. This is the standard approach in  many-body theory. 
\end{itemize}

\noindent
The correlation energy is defined as, with a two-body Hamiltonian,  
\[
\Delta E=\sum_{ai}\langle i| \hat{f}|a \rangle C_{i}^{a}+
\sum_{abij}\langle ij | \hat{v}| ab \rangle C_{ij}^{ab}.
\]

The coefficients $C$ result from the solution of the eigenvalue problem. 
The energy of say the ground state is then
\[
E=E_{ref}+\Delta E,
\]
where the so-called reference energy is the energy we obtain from a Hartree-Fock calculation, that is
\[
E_{ref}=\langle \Phi_0 \vert \hat{H} \vert \Phi_0 \rangle.
\]

However, as we have seen, even for a small case like the four first major shells and a nucleus like oxygen-16, the dimensionality becomes quickly intractable. If we wish to include single-particle states that reflect weakly bound systems, we need a much larger single-particle basis. We need thus approximative methods that sum specific correlations to infinite order. 

Popular methods are
\begin{itemize}
\item Many-body perturbation theory (in essence a Taylor expansion)

\item Coupled cluster theory (coupled non-linear equations)

\item Green's function approaches (matrix inversion)

\item Similarity group transformation methods (coupled ordinary differential equations
\end{itemize}

\noindent
All these methods start normally with a Hartree-Fock basis as the calculational basis. 


\paragraph{A quick tour of Coupled Cluster theory.}
The ansatz for the wavefunction (ground state) is given by
\begin{equation*}
   \vert \Psi\rangle = \vert \Psi_{CC}\rangle = e^{\hat{T}} \vert \Phi_0\rangle =  
  \left( \sum_{n=1}^{A} \frac{1}{n!} \hat{T}^n \right) \vert \Phi_0\rangle,
\end{equation*}
where $A$ represents the maximum number of particle-hole excitations and $\hat{T}$ is the cluster operator defined as
\begin{align*}
            \hat{T} &= \hat{T}_1 + \hat{T}_2 + \ldots + \hat{T}_A \\
            \hat{T}_n &= \left(\frac{1}{n!}\right)^2 
                \sum_{\substack{
                        i_1,i_2,\ldots i_n \\
                        a_1,a_2,\ldots a_n}}
                t_{i_1i_2\ldots i_n}^{a_1a_2\ldots a_n} a_{a_1}^\dagger a_{a_2}^\dagger \ldots a_{a_n}^\dagger a_{i_n} \ldots a_{i_2} a_{i_1}.
        \end{align*}
    The energy is given by
    \begin{equation*}
        E_{\mathrm{CC}} = \langle\Phi_0\vert  \overline{H}\vert \Phi_0\rangle,
    \end{equation*}
    where $\overline{H}$ is a similarity transformed Hamiltonian
    \begin{align*}
        \overline{H}&= e^{-\hat{T}} \hat{H}_N e^{\hat{T}} \\
        \hat{H}_N &= \hat{H} - \langle\Phi_0\vert \hat{H} \vert \Phi_0\rangle.
    \end{align*}

    The coupled cluster energy is a function of the unknown cluster amplitudes $t_{i_1i_2\ldots i_n}^{a_1a_2\ldots a_n}$,
given by the solutions to the amplitude equations
    \begin{equation*}
        0 = \langle\Phi_{i_1 \ldots i_n}^{a_1 \ldots a_n}\vert \overline{H}\vert \Phi_0\rangle.
    \end{equation*}
The similarity transformed   Hamiltonian  $\overline{H}$ is expanded using the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expression,
    \begin{align*}
        \overline{H}&= \hat{H}_N + \left[ \hat{H}_N, \hat{T} \right] + 
            \frac{1}{2} \left[\left[ \hat{H}_N, \hat{T} \right], \hat{T}\right] + \ldots \\
            & \quad \frac{1}{n!} \left[ \ldots \left[ \hat{H}_N, \hat{T} \right], \ldots \hat{T} \right] +\dots
    \end{align*}
and simplified using the connected cluster theorem
    \begin{equation*}
        \overline{H}= \hat{H}_N + \left( \hat{H}_N \hat{T}\right)_c + \frac{1}{2} \left( \hat{H}_N \hat{T}^2\right)_c
            + \dots + \frac{1}{n!} \left( \hat{H}_N \hat{T}^n\right)_c +\dots
    \end{equation*}

A much used approximation is to  truncate the cluster operator $\hat{T}$ at the $n=2$ level. This defines the so-called singes and doubles approximation to the Coupled Cluster wavefunction, normally shortened to CCSD..

The coupled cluster wavefunction is now given by
\begin{equation*}
            \vert \Psi_{CC}\rangle = e^{\hat{T}_1 + \hat{T}_2} \vert \Phi_0\rangle
\end{equation*}
where 
        \begin{align*}
            \hat{T}_1 &= 
            \sum_{ia}
                t_{i}^{a} a_{a}^\dagger a_i \\
            \hat{T}_2 &= \frac{1}{4} 
            \sum_{ijab}
                t_{ij}^{ab} a_{a}^\dagger a_{b}^\dagger a_{j} a_{i}.
        \end{align*}

The amplutudes $t$ play a role similar to the coefficients $C$ in the shell-model calculations. They are obtained by solving a set of non-linear equations
similar to those discussed above in connection withe FCI discussion.

If we truncate our equations at the CCSD level, it corresponds to performing a transformation of the Hamiltonian matrix of the following type for a six particle problem (with a two-body Hamiltonian):

\end{tabular}
\end{quote}

\noindent


In our FCI discussion the correlation energy is defined as, with a two-body Hamiltonian,  
\[
\Delta E=\sum_{ai}\langle i| \hat{f}|a \rangle C_{i}^{a}+
\sum_{abij}\langle ij | \hat{v}| ab \rangle C_{ij}^{ab}.
\]

In Coupled cluster theory it becomes (irrespective of level of truncation of $T$)
\[
\Delta E=\sum_{ai}\langle i| \hat{f}|a \rangle t_{i}^{a}+
\sum_{abij}\langle ij | \hat{v}| ab \rangle t_{ij}^{ab}.
\]

Coupled cluster theory has several interesting computational features and is the method of choice in quantum chemistry. The method was originally proposed by Coester and Kummel, two nuclear physicists (way back in the fifties). It came back in full strength in nuclear physics during the last decade. 

There are several interesting features:
\begin{itemize}
\item With a truncation like CCSD or CCSDT, we can include to infinite order correlations like $2p-2h$.

\item We can include a large basis of single-particle states, not possible in standard FCI calculations
\end{itemize}

\noindent
However, Coupled Cluster theory is
\begin{itemize}
\item non-variational

\item if we want to find properties of excited states, additional calculations via for example equation of motion methods are needed

\item if correlations are strong, a single-reference ansatz may not be the best starting point

\item we cannot quantify properly the error we make when truncations are made in the cluster operator
\end{itemize}

\noindent
\subsection{The CCD approximation}

We will now approximate the cluster operator $\hat{T}$ to include only $2p-2h$ correlations. This leads to the so-called CCD approximation, that is
\[
\hat{T}\approx \hat{T}_2=\frac{1}{4}\sum_{abij}t_{ij}^{ab}a^{\dagger}_aa^{\dagger}_ba_ja_i,
\]
meaning that we have
\[
\vert \Psi_0 \rangle \approx \vert \Psi_{CCD} \rangle = \exp{\hat{T}_2}\vert \Phi_0\rangle.
\]

Inserting these equations in the expression for the computation of the energy we have,
with a Hamiltonian defined with respect to a general vacuum (see the exercises in the second quantization part)
\[
\hat{H}=\hat{H}_N+E_{\mathrm{ref}},
\]
with 
\[
\hat{H}_N=\sum_{pq}\langle p \vert \hat{f} \vert q \rangle  a^{\dagger}_pa_q + \frac{1}{4}\sum_{pqrs}\langle pq \vert \hat{v} \vert rs \rangle a^{\dagger}_pa^{\dagger}_qa_sa_r,
\]
we obtain that the energy can be written as 
\[
\langle \Phi_0 \vert \exp{-\hat{T}_2}\hat{H}_N\exp{\hat{T}_2}\vert \Phi_0\rangle =
\langle \Phi_0 \vert \hat{H}_N(1+\hat{T}_2)\vert \Phi_0\rangle = E_{CCD}.
\]
This quantity becomes 
\[
E_{CCD}=E_{\mathrm{ref}}+\frac{1}{4}\sum_{abij}\langle ij \vert \hat{v} \vert ab \rangle t_{ij}^{ab},
\]
where the latter is the correlation energy from this level of approximation of CC theory. 
Similarly, the expression for the amplitudes reads
\[
\langle \Phi_{ij}^{ab} \vert \exp{-\hat{T}_2}\hat{H}_N\exp{\hat{T}_2}\vert \Phi_0\rangle = 0.
\]
These equations can be reduced to (after several rounds of contractions) to MORE material to come.
